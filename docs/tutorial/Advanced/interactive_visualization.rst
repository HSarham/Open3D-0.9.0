Interactive visualization
-------------------------------------

This tutorial introduces user interaction features of visualizer window.

This script executes two applications of user interaction: ``demo_crop_geometry()`` and ``demo_manual_registration()``.

.. _crop_geometry:

This function simply reads a point cloud and calls ``draw_geometries_with_editing``. This function provides vertex selection and cropping.

.. Note:: Open3D has ``VisualizerWithEditing`` class that inherits ``Visualizer`` class. It adds graphic user interaction feature. Likewise examples in :ref:`customized_visualization`, ``VisualizerWithEditing()`` can be explicitly used instead ``draw_geometries_with_editing([pcd])``.

Once a geometry is displayed, press ``Y`` twice to align geometry with negative direction of y-axis. After adjusting viewing orientation, press ``K`` to lock screen and to switch to the selection mode.

.. Tip:: The practical step for selecting area is to align the geometry with arbitrary axis using orthographic projection model. This trick makes selection easier, because it avoids self-occlusion hassle due to perspective projection.

To select a region, use either ``mouse drag`` (rectangle selection) or ``ctrl + left mouse click`` (polygon selection). The below example shows a selected area using a polygon.

Note that the selected area is dark shaded. To keep the selected area and discard the rest, press ``C``. It pops up a dialog box to save cropped geometry. Cropping result is shown after saving.

To finish selection mode, press ``F`` to switch to freeview mode.

Select correspondences
=====================================

The following script register two point clouds using point-to-point ICP. It gets initial alignment via user interaction.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/Python/Advanced/interactive_visualization.py

The script reads two point clouds, and visualize the point clouds before alignment.

Function ``pick_points(pcd)`` makes an instance of ``VisualizerWithEditing``. To mimic ``draw_geometries``, it creates windows, adds geometry, visualize geometry, and terminates. A novel interface function from ``VisualizerWithEditing`` is ``get_picked_points()`` that returns the indices of user-picked vertices.

To pick a vertex, press ``shift + left click`` on a window. If a vertex is selected, the visualizer window overlays a sphere on a selected vertex. For example, after picking three vertices in the source point cloud, it shows:

.. image:: ../../_static/Advanced/interactive_visualization/manual_icp_source.png
    :width: 400px

This will print:

.. code-block:: sh

    Picked point #58481 (2.14, 1.56, 1.53) to add in queue.
    Picked point #77321 (2.86, 1.92, 1.09) to add in queue.
    Picked point #42639 (3.28, 1.53, 1.45) to add in queue.

Press ``q`` to close window. The next step is to pick the same correspondences in the target point cloud. The color of sphere helps to identify the same correspondence.

.. image:: ../../_static/Advanced/interactive_visualization/manual_icp_target.png
    :width: 400px

This will print:

.. code-block:: sh

    Picked point #54028 (1.62, 1.81, 1.23) to add in queue.
    Picked point #97115 (2.45, 2.19, 1.11) to add in queue.
    Picked point #47467 (2.75, 1.71, 1.45) to add in queue.

.. Tip:: To get a good registration result, try to pick more than three points that are well-distributed in the scene. Using a vertex on the corner region is a good way to easily pick the right correspondence.

Registration using user correspondences
=======================================

The later part of the demo computes an initial transformation based on the user-provided correspondences. This script builds pairs of correspondences using ``Vector2iVector(corr)``. It utilizes ``TransformationEstimationPointToPoint.compute_transformation`` to compute the initial transformation from the correspondences. The initial transformation is refined using ``registration_icp``.

The registration result follows:
